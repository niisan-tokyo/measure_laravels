# AWS上で検証

# Amazon linux 立ち上げ

- t2.micro

# http server 用

## docker install

こちらを参考  
https://qiita.com/reoring/items/0d1f556064d363f0ccb8

```
sudo yum update
sudo yum install -y docker git
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
sudo systemctl enable docker
exit
# 再接続する
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

## composerで依存性解決

```
cd compose
docker-compose run --rm swoole bash
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

## 起動

```
docker-compose up swoole
```

# 検証側

## ab インストール

```
sudo yum update
sudo yum install -y apr-util
sudo yum install httpd-tools
```

# 検証開始

## laravelS 単体

これを走らせる

```

## nginx + swoole

これやっておく

```
mv nginx/sites/default.conf nginx/sites/default.sconf
mv nginx/sites/swoole.sconf nginx/sites/swoole.conf
```

docker-compose.yml もちょっと書き換え

```
swoole:
    build: swoole/
    volumes:
      - ../blog:/var/www
    ports:
      - "81:5200"
    command: php ./bin/laravels start
```

port ちょっと変える

```
ab -n 10000 -c 50 http://ip-172-31-7-80.ap-northeast-1.compute.internal/
```

```
$ ab -n 10000 -c 50 http://ip-172-31-7-80.ap-northeast-1.compute.internal/
